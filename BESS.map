RISC-based VSC_NET1 Bridge model named: BRDG1
   in subsystem: #1
   is assigned to PB5 Card #2 Processor A

   The Bridge model has 27 small
     time-steps in each large time-step.

   The small time-step size is 1.851852 microseconds.

   The calculation time permitted for each
     small time-step is 1751 nanoseconds.

   Any T0 output is scheduled for small step number: 2.
   Any T2 output is scheduled for small step number: 13.

   A User specified safety margin of  360 nSec
     is added to the the expected small-step execution time
     to avoid small time-step calculation overflow.

   The small-step code on the first PB5 processor
     would be expected to take 1650 clocks to execute
     ( 1650 nSec ) on a GPC processor without the margin.
     On the PB5, the code is expected to take
     approximately 1375 nSec without the margin.
     Including the margin, the expected small-step execution
     time on the first PB5 processor is 1735 nSec.

   Based on a consideration of all the processors in the
     connected bridge group, the small-step execution time
     on all processors in the connected bridge group 
     is selected as 1735 nSec including margin.

   The following is the order of execution of VSC components 
     that have both named-signal input and named-signal output.
     These components are referred to as "mid-list" components
     because they come after components that have exclusively
     named-signal output ( "prefix" components )
     and before components that have exclusively
     named-signal input ( "suffix" components ).
